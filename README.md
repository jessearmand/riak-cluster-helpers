These scripts are based on the riak fast track, [Building a Development Environment](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Building-a-Development-Environment/).

It is also based on the helper script to [run 4 nodes riak cluster on a Mac OS X Homebrew installation](http://ottopoellath.github.com/blog/2012/04/08/running-a-three-node-riak-cluster-using-a-homebrew-installation/).

Just run `brew_riak_node_create.sh` and all of the other scripts correspond to the steps in the riak fast track.
